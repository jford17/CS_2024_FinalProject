# CS_2024_FinalProject
For our project, we will be extending the poker problem we worked on earlier in the semester. 
We already have classes RandomInt, Card, DeckOfCards, and Hand, and we will add classes Player, AI, and Game. 
Half of the group will work primarily on developing these three back end classes in C++. 
The other half of the group will work on building out a GUI in Java allowing a human player (represented by class Player) 
to play Texas Hold â€˜Em poker against the AI on an Android device.
